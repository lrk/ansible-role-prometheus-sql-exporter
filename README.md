#   - is converted to a configuration file and multiple collector files
#   - get its own systemd unit file
#   - YOU MUST ensure that listen_address DOES NOT overlap beteen targets to avoid conflicts
#
# Each collector file, which is based on the collector name, MUST BE UNIQUE
# See example below
prom_sexp_targets: []

# prom_sexp_targets:
#     # the target name, configuration file generated is based on this value
#   - name: target_name
#     # if the value==present, configuration files are created, if value!=present, configuration files are deleted. Default value: present

#     # Address to listen on for web interface and telemetry. (default ":9399")
#     listen_address: ":9399"
#     # Path under which to expose metrics. (default "/metrics")
#     metrics_path: "/metrics"
#     # Scrape timeouts ensure that:
#     #   (i)  scraping completes in reasonable time and
#     #   (ii) slow queries are canceled early when the database is already under heavy load
#     # Prometheus informs targets of its own scrape timeout (via the "X-Prometheus-Scrape-Timeout-Seconds" request header)
#     # so the actual timeout is computed as:
#     #   min(scrape_timeout, X-Prometheus-Scrape-Timeout-Seconds - scrape_timeout_offset)
#     #
#     # If scrape_timeout <= 0, no timeout is set unless Prometheus provides one. The default is 10s.
#     scrape_timeout: 10s
#     # Subtracted from Prometheus' scrape_timeout to give us some headroom and prevent Prometheus from timing out first.

#     # Must be strictly positive. The default is 500ms.

#     # as will concurrent scrapes.
#     #
#     # If max_connections <= 0, then there is no limit on the number of open connections. The default is 3.
#     max_connections: 3
#     # Maximum number of idle connections to any one target. Unless you use very long collection intervals, this should
#     # always be the same as max_connections.

#     max_idle_connections: 3

# A collector is a named set of related metrics that are collected together. It can be referenced by name, possibly

# Collectors may be defined inline (under `collectors`) or loaded from `collector_files` (one collector per file).

# # A metric is a Prometheus metric with name, type, help text and (optional) additional labels, paired with exactly
# # one query to populate the metric labels and values from.
# #
# # The result columns conceptually fall into two categories:
# #  * zero or more key columns: their values will be directly mapped to labels of the same name;
# #  * one or more value columns:
# #     * if exactly one value column, the column name name is ignored and its value becomes the metric value
# #     * with multiple value columns, a `value_label` must be defined; the column name will populate this label and
# #       the column value will popilate the metric value.
